        <h2>Project Purpose & Goal</h2>
        <p>
            Menstrual Equity is defined as the affordability, accessibility, and safety of menstrual products. In the
            domain of this project, it is concerning students, faculty, staff, and visitors to the HCC Campus (“campus
            community”). Access to menstrual products is a critical element of everyday life, consistent classroom
            attendance, comfort during commitment to academic programs, and essential human dignity. The three pillars
            of the initiative are Dignity, Accessibility, and Sustainability. Dignity is the aspect of people from all
            cultures and backgrounds feeling welcome and comfortable in participating in this initiative. As
            menstruation is a taboo subject in many cultures, this project will seek to maintain professionalism in
            presentation, and to integrate the normality of menstruation into the background of the college campus.
            Dignity also leads to Accessibility, in that in order to readily access the products, patrons must feel they
            can do so without calling unnecessary attention to their needs, or causing excess burden or hardship.
            Accessibility also refers to the platform incurring as little cost as possible to the institution.
            Accessibility also means that this project will feature numerous different products, including some of the
            more difficult-to-find or costlier products. This will help ensure that the program is also Sustainable, as
            reusable products producing decreased landfill waste also tend to be costlier. In that, the ideal products
            for this project should be as plastic-free as possible, as well as being organic, and containing no
            bleaching agents or carcinogens, as many of the cheapest products do contain (Jin, 2018). This provision
            reflects the menstrual equity tenet of safety in menstrual products.

        <h2>Project Scope</h2>
        <p>
            As part of Holyoke Community College, “HCC cares about M.E.” will work through the HCC Thrive Center to get
            free products to the target demographic (“patrons”). This will be done via product drives and donations from
            the community, as well as using earmarked funds from the HCC Foundation. The project will seek to place
            hospitality stations (“stations”) in prominent department lounges and offices on the HCC Campus. At launch,
            the project will include at least 3 stations on campus, but ideally and over time these stations will be
            located in each building on campus, with one station for each bathroom in any given building. They will not
            be located within any actual bathrooms, due to the need to adhere to ADA regulations, as well as eliminating
            any risk of the project interfering with the responsibilities of custodial staff. Therefore, stations will
            be best placed on desks, counters, or tables, in prominent offices or department lounges, for patrons to
            simply take as they need. The Thrive Center Director, Rosemary Fiedler, has indicated that Thrive does not
            have the resources to make this project a reality in the Fall 2021 Semester. This is due to staffing
            concerns as well as other projects that Thrive is currently committed to fulfilling in the interim.
            Therefore, it is appropriate to anticipate project completion in Spring 2022. At the time of the writing of
            this proposal, contact has been made with the Student Advisory Council of Massachusetts (“SAC”), with
            request to add menstrual equity to their 2021-2022 agenda. Charity groups such as No More Secrets MPS and
            retail groups such as DivaCup have provided donations and networking assistance to HCC. Successful outreach
            to the HCC student body for volunteers has been established, and opportunity for extracurricular service
            hours through Thrive has been offered. The focus and principles of menstrual equity indicate that the health
            of the menstruating body is the paramount focus. Menstrual equity does not make provisions for safe sex
            products such as condoms. These products will not be included in the stations. In the past, such products
            have been customarily distributed by Health Services, however, this campus department has been retrenched,
            and Thrive has not absorbed the duties or functions of Health Services. Furthermore, while human biology
            indicates that menstruation and reproduction are inexorably linked, it is crucial that menstruation be
            separated from sexual intercourse, insofar as the purpose and success of this program.

        <h2>Deliverables</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hospitality Stations: Stations will consist of containers small enough to accommodate ADA regulations
                (approximately 8.5”x11” baskets or boxes). To ensure consistency of messaging, these stations will
                maintain uniformity and blend into the background of most departments. The stations will be kept clean
                and neatly organized by student volunteers (see Affected Parties), providing a wide-range of different
                products to accommodate diverse needs. Informational Signage: At each station, as well as in
                high-traffic areas on campus, informational signs (18”x22”) will describe the program, and indicate how
                a given individual may participate. When a patron encounters signage at a given station, the location of
                the particular station should be indicated.</li>
            <li>Educational Literature: Stations will include informational postcards describing the program, what is
                offered, what other services can be obtained through Thrive, as well as a QR code and link for a campus
                map reflecting other station locations, and survey that will collect data for Thrive. </li>
            <li>Participant Survey: Using a QR Code and/or link, a patron will access a Google form containing a brief
                survey about their experience with the program. This survey must be accessed through multiple modalities
                to accommodate patrons of differing abilities and technological access. In collecting information about
                the effectiveness of the program (what products are being preferred, what products are being requested,
                what baskets are empty or where services are otherwise lacking), the program may improve over time. As a
                Google form, this survey will provide visual data demonstration for the program.</li>
            <li>Python Django App: Each station may include a QR code, intended to be accessed by student volunteers,
                otherwise the app can be accessed via browser login. This will allow for data collection on the
                effectiveness of the program. With the Thrive Center faculty as administrator, student volunteers will
                have registered accounts that will be used to access the app. Upon access, the user will be able to
                enter information on which products need restock, and administrators will be able to view stations are
                being preferred or are otherwise underutilized, as well as compiling data to demonstrate the necessity
                of basic needs outreach in the community. The app will afford capabilities to print weekly program data
                for Thrive, which will demonstrate patron involvement trends. The app will include complete instructions
                for future users. This app will be versatile in that it can be customized for other purposes, including
                use by the Thrive Food Pantry.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Demographics</h2>
        <p>
            It is acknowledged that not all women menstruate, and not all who menstruate identify as women. When a
            person lacks access to basic hygiene standards, quality of life suffers drastically. Students attending
            Community College often have other critical responsibilities, such as employment, children, elderly parents,
            and financial burdens. Too often, the basic needs of the self are addressed last, or not at all. Withholding
            menstrual products behind antiquated, obsolete bathroom vending machines forces a student to carry coin
            money at the time the need arises, which is uncommon in this era. If a student lacks this coin money, they
            must physically divert themselves from their purpose on the campus to access the Thrive Center.
            Additionally, such vending machines may have been installed during a time when gender was considered a
            binary principle, and some bathrooms may not have these machines installed. These factors not only pose
            unnecessary physical burden and inconvenience, but also calls undue attention to the action of obtaining a
            menstrual hygiene product. Through this program, via the Thrive Center, students will be provided with
            opportunities for community service. Students will commit to agreement through the Thrive Center to provide
            a number of service hours per week. During these service hours, the volunteers will monitor stations and
            signage for restock and maintenance. At this time, student leaders from the Mujeres & Non-Binary Alliance
            club have become invested in gaining information from the student body, insofar as desired products, and
            services. The leader of Mujeres, Miren Neyra Alcantara, has made contact with the makers of DivaCup
            (DivaCup, 2021) and secured a donation to the college, to be dispensed through Thrive when the project is
            running. Additionally, DivaCup has offered free training sessions for the campus community for use of the
            device, which is classified as a class II medical device (FDA, 2018). Additional charity donations have been
            sought through the menstrual equity hub “No More Secrets”, a grassroots organization based out of
            Pennsylvania (No More Secrets MBS, 2020).

            <figcaption class="caption">Chart by J.D. Gi</figcaption>
        </figure>    

        <h2>Long-Term Goals</h2>
        <p>
            Due to the Thrive Center’s reliance on charitable donations, the longevity of the program must be
            considered. MassNOW is a grassroots program which seeks state tax funding for menstrual products in grade
            schools, temporary housing and relief shelters, and facilities for incarcerated individuals (MassNOW).
            Advocacy will take place to urge the State Legislature to account for additional, free menstrual products in
            higher education as well. This advocacy will take place via SAC, which has agreed to place menstrual equity
            in higher education on their agenda for the 2021-2022 academic year. This advocacy would aim to advocate for
            elimination of the barriers that students face with regard to menstrual equity.

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of the 2021 Fall Semester will be to lay the groundwork for the program, including making
            connections with volunteers, composing the literature components, creating the hospitality stations (baskets
            and signs), and composing the blueprint for the API. The Python Flask Server API (Smyth, 2020) will be
            developed gradually with a goal of a functioning server, with registered users, by May 2022. To facilitate
            greatest reach, a pre-screening will be sought, via Marketing and Communications, to ascertain the campus
            community’s perception of need. At the end of the 2021 Fall Semester, the NSF Seminar presentation of this
            project will include an explanation of the understanding of basic needs insecurity as experienced by the
            campus community, how conjunction of effort between the volunteers and the technology (API) will improve
            coordination of basic needs goods for those in need, as well as presenting the informational literature,
            signage, and station fixtures that have been developed to date. Goals for the 2022 Spring Semester will
            include incorporating stations into the departments who have expressed interest, with at least three
            functioning stations by launch date, and deployment of the program server. By the end of the 2022 Spring
            Semester, this program will be a complete package, which Thrive, along with any future student leader, will
            be able to continue on from.
