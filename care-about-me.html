        <h2>Project Purpose & Goal</h2>
        <p>
            Menstrual Equity is defined as the affordability, accessibility, and safety of menstrual products. In the
            domain of this project, it concerns students, faculty, staff, and visitors to the HCC Campus ("campus
            community"). Access to menstrual products is a critical element of everyday life, consistent classroom
            attendance, commitment to academic programs, and essential human dignity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The three pillars
            of the Care About M.E. initiative are Dignity, Accessibility, and Sustainability. Dignity is the aspect of
            people from all
            cultures and backgrounds feeling welcome and comfortable in participating in this initiative. As
            menstruation is a taboo subject in many cultures, this project will seek to maintain the normality of
            menstruation into the daily activity of the college campus.
            Dignity leads to Accessibility, as patrons must feel they
            can access the products without calling unnecessary attention to their needs or causing themselves excess
            burden or hardship. Therefore, Accessibility also refers to the platform incurring as little cost as
            possible to the institution.
            Furthermore, Accessibility also means this project will feature a diversity of products to include diverse
            needs.
            This will help ensure that the program is also Sustainable, with reusable and biodegradable products. In
            that,
            the ideal products for this project should be as plastic-free as possible, as well as being organic,
            and containing no bleaching agents or carcinogens, as many of the cheapest products do contain (Jin, 2018).
            This provision
            reflects the menstrual equity tenet of safety in menstrual products.

        <h2>Project Scope</h2>
        <p>
            As part of Holyoke Community College, "HCC cares about M.E." will work through the HCC Thrive Center to
            obtain
            free products via product drives and donations, as well as with earmarked funds from the HCC Foundation.
            The project will seek to place
            hospitality stations ("stations") in prominent department lounges and offices on the HCC Campus. At launch,
            the project will include at least 3 stations on campus, with the long-term goal of one station for each
            bathroom
            in any given building. Stations will not
            be located within the bathrooms, due to the need to adhere to ADA regulations, as well as eliminating the
            responsibility of
            the products becoming work for the custodial staff. Instead, stations will
            be placed on desks, counters, or tables, in prominent offices or department lounges, in a free-vend format.
            The Menstrual Equity Committee ("committee") has asked the Student Advisory Council of
            Massachusetts ("SAC") to add menstrual equity to their 2021-2022 agenda. Charity groups including No More
            Secrets MPS, and retail groups including DivaCup, have provided product donations
            and networking assistance to HCC. Student volunteers, with opportunity for extracurricular service
            hours through Thrive, will work to maintain the platform.
        </p>

        <p>
            The principles of menstrual equity indicate that the health
            of the menstruating body is the paramount focus, therefore this platform does not make provisions for safe
            sex
            products such as condoms. While human biology
            indicates that menstruation and reproduction are inexorably linked, it is crucial that menstruation be
            separated from sexual intercourse, insofar as the purpose and success of this program.
            Project completion is estimated for Spring 2022.

        <h2>Deliverables</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hospitality Stations: These 8.5"x11" containers will accommodate ADA regulations. To ensure messaging
                consistency
                the stations will be uniform in appearance and professional in presentation. The stations will be kept
                clean
                and neatly organized by student volunteers, providing a diversity of products.</li>
            <li>Informational Signage: At each station and in
                high-traffic campus areas informational signs (18"x22") will describe the program and how to
                participate.
                Any given sign will indicate the station's location name.</li>
            <li>Educational Literature: Informational postcards will describe the program, other services offered by
                Thrive,
                a QR code and link for a campus map of all station locations, and survey for participation data.</li>
            <li>Participant Survey: The survey will be a Google form managed by Thrive and will gauge patron experience
                with the program.
                This survey will measure program effectiveness of the program (what products are being preferred, what
                products are being requested,
                what baskets are empty or where services are otherwise lacking) so the program may improve over time.
            </li>
            <li>Python Django App: With the Thrive Center faculty as administrator, student volunteers will
                have registered accounts they will use to enter product restock information. This information will show
                preferred or underutilized stations, and overall success of the program. The app will be modular,
                and may be customized for other purposes including use by the Thrive Food Pantry.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Demographics</h2>
        <p>
            It is acknowledged that not all women menstruate, and not all who menstruate identify as women. When a
            person lacks access to basic hygiene standards, quality of life suffers drastically. Students attending
            Community College often have other critical responsibilities, such as employment, children, elderly parents,
            and financial burdens. Too often, the basic needs of the self are addressed last, or not at all. Withholding
            menstrual products behind antiquated, obsolete bathroom vending machines forces a student to carry coin
            money at the time the need arises, which is uncommon in this era. Such vending machines have been installed
            during a time when gender was considered a
            binary principle, and many bathrooms lack these expensive machines. These factors contribute to an
            unnecessary barrier to obtaining essential menstrual products.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through this program, via the Thrive Center, students will be provided with
            opportunities for community service hours during which volunteers will monitor stations and
            signage for restock and maintenance. Additionally, DivaCup has offered free training sessions
            for use and care of their product, which is classified as a class II medical device (FDA, 2018).
            Additional donations have been sought through the menstrual equity hub “No More Secrets”,
            a grassroots organization based out of
            Pennsylvania (No More Secrets MBS, 2020).

        </figure>

        <h2>Long-Term Goals</h2>
        <p>
            MassNOW is a grassroots program which seeks state tax funding for menstrual products in grade
            schools, temporary housing and relief shelters, and carceral centers (MassNOW).
            Advocacy through SAC will urge the MA State Legislature to account for free menstrual products in
            higher education institutions, for elimination of the barriers that students face with regard to menstrual
            equity.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of this iteration will be to lay the groundwork for the program, including making
            connections with volunteers, composing the literature components, creating the hospitality stations (baskets
            and signs), and composing the blueprint for the API. The Python Flask Server API will be
            developed gradually with a goal of a functioning server, with registered users, by May 2022. To facilitate
            greatest reach, a pre-screening will be sought, via Marketing and Communications, to ascertain the campus
            community's perception of need.
        </p>
        <p>
            Future goals will include incorporating stations into the campus departments who have expressed interest,
            with at least three functioning stations by launch date, and deployment of the program server.
            By the end of the 2022 Spring
            Semester, this program will be a complete package, which Thrive, along with any future student leader, will
            be equipped to continue.

        <h2>Inventory Software</h2>
        <p>
            The software written in the Python Django framework is available via <a
                href="https://github.com/JDGi-Code/CARE-ABOUT-ME-App" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
            <br>Using this software, multiple permission gates may be set, and inventory may be tracked including
            frequency of restock and the locations of each product basket.
