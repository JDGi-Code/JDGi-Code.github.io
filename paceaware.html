        <h2>Project Purpose & Goal</h2>
        <p>
            Dementia impacts over 50 million people globally. Each year, 10 million more people are diagnosed with
            dementia. Informal caregiving by family and friends makes up the majority of circumstances, and involves
            constant monitoring for problematic behaviors such as wandering. Wandering behavior occurs when the
            individual becomes restless and begins to walk without destination. This type of behavior can be dangerous,
            leading to the individual becoming stranded, lost, and injured.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dementia-induced wandering is often preceded by pacing activity, characterized by repetitive walking
            patterns. If pacing can be detected, and a caregiver can be alerted to the activity, then it is possible
            that intervention by a caregiver can prevent wandering behavior from commencing. This type of activity
            monitoring can enhance caregiver independence, while also improving quality of life and safety for the
            dementia-afflicted individual.

        <h2>Application Files</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Accelmagno_maker.py
                <br>This file is necessary to turn separate files - Accelerometer.csv and Magnetometer.csv - into one
                single
                file called AccelMagno.csv. The combined file is read as training data.
                The function takes base_filename as a parameter.
                It reads the accelerometer data from "Accelerometer.csv" and the magnetometer data from
                "Magnetometer.csv"
                within the specified base directory.
                The 'time' column in both DataFrames is converted to datetime format using pd.to_datetime.
                From there, a new DataFrame new_df is created with columns for time, accelerometer (x, y, z), and
                magnetometer readings (x, y, z). The sensor values are rounded to 6 decimal places using round(6) to
                force
                the data into a uniform float32 format.
                new_df is saved saved as "AccelMagno.csv" which is used for the training data.
            </li>

            <li>
                squisher.py
                <br>The AccelMagno.csv files from each of the training data activity types (sitting, standing, walking,
                pacing)
                are combined into two distinct categories - not_pacing and pacing.
                In this way, multiple sessions of pacing could be combined to increase the data set for pacing, and all
                the
                non-pacing data could be combined as non-pacing activities.
                This labeled data is used as training data.
            </li>

            <li>
                pacing_detection.py
                <br>This file performs the following tasks:
                <br>calc_magnitude(data): performs the magnitude calculations.
                <br>remove_noise(data, sampling_rate): removes the data noise.
                <br>add_features(window): calculates features for accel and magno.
                <br>extract_features(data, window_sec, sample_rate, activity): reformats the time column, resamples the
                data
                into windows, and calls add_features on the windows.
                <br>train_tree(frames): performs an accuracy test on the data (result: 91% accuracy). This function also
                writes
                a model to a pickle dump.
                <br>classify_live_window(df): calls all previous functions and reads the pickle.
                <br>test_live_classifier: Read by the server file.
            </li>

            <li>
                server.py
                <br>This updated version of sensor_logger_listen.py reads signals from accelerometer and magnetometer
                only. The
                window is declared as 10 seconds and Hz is defined at 100.
                This file calls classify_live_window and returns the status of the user as 'Detecting', which indicates
                no
                pacing behavior has been detected, and 'CAUTION: Pacing Detected', which indicates to the caregiver that
                the
                user has commenced a pacing behavior. I felt this was necessary, as a caregiver may miss the importance
                of
                the change in detected behavior unless there is a more pronounced distinction between the states.
                Data Collection, Model Training, and Testing/ Analysis
                15 minutes of sitting, standing, and walking activity were recorded separately and then grouped into a
                single 'not_pacing' category. When detected, the program returns a green text stating "Detecting…"
                because
                returning exactly what the individual is doing at any given time (sitting, standing, or walking) seemed
                to
                encourage a 'surveillance' quality that is not desired. Pacing is classified as multiple magnetometer
                heading changes within a 10-second window. When detected, the program returns a yellow text stating
                "CAUTION: Pacing Detected", accompanied by a pleasant alert sound. This alert will prompt the caregiver
                to
                check in on the dementia-afflicted individual, and commence intervention techniques. This functionality
                encourages increased independence for the caregiver by providing easily-recognizable changes in activity
                detection, thereby improving quality of care for the individual who is in an informal care setting such
                as a family home.

        <h2>Model Evaluation & Results</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>15 min of data collected for each type (sitting, standing, walking, pacing), combined into categories
                'not_pacing' and 'pacing'. With over 61,000 windows, the model takes over 3 minutes to create.</li>
            <li>Extracted Features: mean, quartiles, and stD from both sensors, accelerometer & magnetometer. </li>
            <li>Decision Tree with depth 3 achieved zero entropy for at least one category on each level</li>
            <li>Accuracy of 92%</li>
            <li>Sitting appears to have poor classification, however this was deemed acceptable as it remains clearly
                distinguished as 'not_pacing' </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Table 1: Model classification for individual activities. A recall of 1 for pacing suggests that the model
            effectively captures all instances of pacing activity. However, recalls of .75 for sitting and .67 for
            standing indicate slightly lower rates of correctly identifying these activities. Conversely, walking
            exhibits a high recall of .96, signifying strong performance in accurately recognizing walking behavior.
            Stationary activities might have lower recall than dynamic activities due to the complexity and variability
            of motion patterns associated with the dynamic states. The subtle differences in sensor data during
            sedentary actions could make it more challenging for the algorithm to accurately capture and classify these
            activities, leading to a lower recall. On the other hand, dynamic activities typically exhibit more distinct
            and recognizable motion patterns, facilitating a higher recall as the algorithm can more effectively discern
            and identify these dynamic movements. Overall, it is deemed acceptable for there to be lower recall for the
            individual activities, because the different states were later separated into two distinct categories:
            pacing and not_pacing.

        <p>
            Table 2: Model classification for not_pacing and pacing categories. The algorithm's ability to accurately
            identify instances of not_pacing activities appears notably strong, resulting in a high recall rate. In
            contrast, the slightly lower recall for pacing activity might stem from the challenges in accurately
            capturing all instances due to its specific motion patterns or variability compared to other activities.
            This difference in recall rates indicates a performance difference in detecting different categories based
            on their unique features.
        </p>
        <p>
            Confusion matrix: Appearing below Table 2, the CM has two rows (top row is not_pacing, bottom is
            pacing). The confusion matrix reflects a high count of true negatives and true positives, with a small
            number of false classifications. This is highly encouraging. Although all activities were collected with the
            same amount of time each (15 minutes), it appears that the model will benefit from an increased amount of
            data in future iterations.
            <br>TN: 28 instances of not_pacing correctly classified as not_pacing.
            <br>FP: 1 instance of pacing incorrectly classified as not_pacing.
            <br>FN: 2 instances of not_pacing incorrectly classified as pacing.
            <br>TP: 12 instances of pacing correctly classified as pacing.

        </figure>
        <p>
            Table 3: This decision tree with a depth of 3 shows the clear distinction between pacing and not_pacing as
            learned by the classifier. It is very motivating to see some leaves with an entropy of zero. Although this
            implies the model is highly capable of classifying not_pacing vs. pacing activity, the results reinforce the
            concept that more data would benefit the performance in future iterations.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            The most challenging component in this project was in integrating the two accelerometer and magnetometer.
            Once I viewed the recordings from two sensors taken at once, I saw that they were separate zip files
            containing dataframes that appeared to be nearly identical. This required data cleaning and changes to the
            core functions (ie, calc_magnitude). This was very challenging at first and I wasn’t sure if I would be able
            to do it, but once I did a little research into how this is done with arduino machines, I was able to do it
            in my program. It was also a bit of an experiment to decide which features to use. I just threw everything
            at it and the machine learning figured it out, however I think I would like to learn more deeply which
            features are best for this specific application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the program effectively detects pacing vs. not_pacing and offers a discrete feedback system,
            improvements can be made. Searching online, I was unable to find examples of what dementia pacing looks
            like. I could only find written descriptions of “anxiety-induced restless behavior”, for instance, a person
            might imitate repeatedly performing tasks in the home. To imitate that, I tried to repeatedly perform tasks,
            for instance walking between the kitchen sink and the front window. However, I'm not confident this is a
            true depiction of what dementia pacing looks like. Therefore, I feel the program could be improved with
            better pacing data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, in future versions, it would be more beneficial to have the output from the patient's wearable
            fed to a paired wearable worn by the caregiver. Given the time constraints of the project, and my own
            limited experience with working with multiple devices, I chose the solution as output to my laptop screen.
            This seemed acceptable, as a caregiver could monitor the activity on their own computer screen or workspace.
            I am pleased with the outcome of the project and I look forward to opportunities to improve it further in
            future iterations.
