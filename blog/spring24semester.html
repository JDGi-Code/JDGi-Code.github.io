    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        The heart of bullet journaling, or bujo, is to find a rhythm within one’s life patterns. The rhythm helps me to understand my motivations and approach problems in ways that are most effective for the way I see the world. This project examines my faithful bujo companion, through a 14-week senior semester at UMass Amherst. This endeavor is a voyage into the sea of my daily responsibilities and dreams, where rigid organization meets colorful expression. As a devoted bujo practitioner, I embark on this journey to sift through the sand of my weekly needfuls to reveal the roots of my methods within my pages, embedded in my daily planning habits. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of my personal planning may enhance my approach to time management and possibly offer interesting insights for others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bujo is special to me because I credit this tool as being instrumental in helping me to overcome personal obstacles and achieve my personal standards of excellence. I fully believe that anyone can benefit from bujo techniques, which are infinite in variety and purpose. This project may be of interest to time management enthusiasts and bujo practitioners interested in the techniques, and their outcomes. By analyzing and sharing my experience, I hope to make the connection with students and bujo enthusiasts, to facilitate our collective journey toward more satisfying productivity.
    </p>
    <h2>Bujo’s Kinesthetic Learning Benefits</h2>
    <p>
        Bullet journaling is all about getting hands-on with your thoughts, tasks, and goals. It's a tactile experience that blends writing, drawing, and organizing information on paper. When you create and manipulate the pages, you're not just engaging your hands but multiple senses, which helps reinforce your understanding and memory of the material.
    </p>
    <p>
        The bujo is your personal space, tailored to fit your needs and preferences. This customization taps into kinesthetic learning, where you shape your learning environment to match your unique style. This personal touch exceeds aesthetics, and makes your obligations and goals resonate with you, giving you a real mastery over your plans.
    </p>
    <p>
        Self expression - in this case, playing with colors, symbols, and designs - is a core concept of kinesthetic learning, helping users connect deeply with objectives and self-reflection, and make meaningful connections between ideas. But even more, interacting with your personalized bujo enhances your memory of concepts, tasks, and goals. This tactile reinforcement is at the heart of kinesthetic learning; by physically moving and feeling the information, you encode it more effectively into your memory.
    </p>
    <h2>Research Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>How many total objectives did I set each week, and what’s the average weekly obligation count?</li>
        <li>How many objectives were deferred to future dates, and why?</li>
        <li>Which weeks had the highest procrastination rates, and what were the underlying reasons?</li>
        <li>How many objectives were completely eliminated from my schedule?</li>
        <li>What can be learned from the design elements used in my bujo?</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Resources Used</h2>
    <p>
        A big part of our bujo community online is sharing supplies used for one's process.
        Largely owing to bujo's kinesthetic learning benefit, supplies are highly personal to the bujo enthusiast, as they become the artist's tools for creating the desired effect.

    <p>
        My bujo pages were created on A5 6-hole punched dot grid paper.
        This paper is somewhat glossy, with low tooth, therefore a Sharpie fine-point (0.4 mm) black felt tip pen is exclusively used.
        The 0.4mm Sharpie pen dries quickly and rarely smudges on this paper.
        However this pen is too fine to write on the washi tape itself, so for that I used a standard Sharpie fine-point marker.
        To decorate the pages, I use Mt brand washi tape and other novelty washi tape from miscellaneous brands.

    </figure>
    <h2>Page Scanning: Form & Technique</h2>
    <p>
        The weekly bujo layout I use, with a Sunday start, I developed by trial and error over the years.
        It has worked best for me to manage both types of collegiate semester needfuls, including my course obligations and associated daily obligations. On one side of the page is a strip of weekdays, from Sunday to Saturday. This side reflects the week number out of 14 total weeks, the day of the week as a letter (S, M, T, W, T, F, S), and the day’s associated calendar date. The opposite side holds all my courses, in this case denoted by their university codes (OIM 350, ENG 391C, SOC 313, and INFO 490PI). The pages are decorated with stickers and colors that I believed would foster energy and motivation required for the daunting task of completing my final semester at UMass Amherst on a high note. I create these pages well in advance of the week taking place; in the case of this project, I created all 14 weekly page outlines before the semester began. This helped me keep a rhythm as I wasn't required to create pages in the middle of a workflow and could plan far in advance.
    </p>
    <h2>A Note on Effective Planning: The Greenhouse of Your Creative Mind</h2>
    <p>
        When facing deadlines, merely noting the final due date often leads to oversight or forgetfulness. Whether it's an academic assignment or a project at work or in your leisure pursuits, setting a realistic deadline is crucial for effective time management. Let's consider a term paper due on May 1, mentioned at the start of classes on February 23. Rather than brushing off this distant deadline, envision April 25 as the true deadline — at least five days in advance. This shift in perspective is akin to planting a seed — the first step in nurturing productivity. Just as a gardener prepares a pot and soil, create a directory for your project and lay out the initial requirements. This directory serves as the fertile ground where your ideas will take root.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, like planting a seed in the soil, sketch out a basic outline for your project. This initial effort, even just a few minutes of work, establishes the foundation for growth. Cultivate your project daily, dedicating at least 15 minutes to its development. Much like tending to a growing plant, consistent attention yields steady progress. Consider each daily session as nurturing your seedling — researching, outlining, drafting. These incremental efforts accumulate, resulting in a robust final product. By the time the "official" deadline approaches, you've not only completed the task but also gained a deeper appreciation and more meaningful understanding of your topic of research.
    </p>
    <p>
        This proactive approach also affords you the luxury of time — a buffer to address unforeseen challenges or explore new insights. Embrace the inevitable distractions and interruptions that may arise during this period, knowing that you're standing on the resilient roots of your productivity. In essence, productivity is a process of cultivation. By treating deadlines as milestones in your growth journey, you empower yourself to flourish and thrive, yielding results that are not just timely but also enriched by the depth of your commitment.

        </div>
    </section>
    <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
    <p>
        After scanning the pages, I loaded the images into Adobe Creative Cloud and cleaned up artifacts left over from the scanner, including black streaks that appeared sometimes in the middle of the pages.
        I also added black lines to redact areas where necessary. These items include the names of people and locations, projects that are in confidential stages, and other private items.
        In this case, it is deemed more important to retain the status of the obligation rather than what the item or event was <i>(see Symbol Identification)</i>.
    </p>
    <h2>Qualitative Analysis</h2>
    <h3>Symbol Identification</h3>
    <figure class="project-img-tiny">
        <img src="images/bujosymbols.png" alt="Symbols used in the bujo project.">
        <figcaption class="caption">Symbols used in the bujo project.</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Filled Circle:</b> Indicates an objective that was completed within the specified deadline.
            If on the date, this objective was completed on that date.
            If within the courses panel, this objective was completed before the week was over or on/before its indicated deadline.
            In some cases, obligations appear simultaneously within the courses panel and the weekly panel within the same week.
            This is due to acknowledgement that the obligation has a deadline for that week, as well as my personal goal-setting of a deadline to complete that weekly needful on a designated date.
        </li>
        <li><b>Arrow in Circle:</b> Indicates this objective was moved to a different date, in the direction the arrow is pointing.
            For example, an arrow pointing right (as in image) indicates this item was pushed forward to another future date.
            Arrows may also point up, down, or left, indicating the objective was moved earlier or later in the same week.
            In rare cases, the arrow may take a different form than this image, such as a typical line with a bracket.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Crossed-Out Circle:</b> Indicates this objective was eliminated completely from the list of tasks.
            There may be many reasons for this, such as event cancellation or a superseding event causing this obligation to become obsolete.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Other Symbols:</b> Redactions have been made to preserve privacy and appear as solid black lines obscuring the event details.
            Some items may also be highlighted in vibrant yellow crayon, indicating obligations that are of the utmost priority and with deadlines that cannot be altered.
        </li>
    <h3>Design Elements</h3>
        Plodding through the final semester of my 4-year university foray was daunting.
        I had often heard of Senior Burnout and I was steadfastly determined not to fall victim to such a thing.
        Something that I believe is key to warding off energy drain is surrounding oneself with positive peripheral ambience.
        For instance, colors, sounds, scents, and textures that improve one's quality of life on a subconscious level and inevitably cause higher improved vibrations on the conscious level.
        Taking for instance Weeks 8 and 9 that appear together when the bujo is opened flat, this cheerful pastel theme was specially designed to get me through the midterms.
        In addition to selecting color combinations that will produce a pleasing visual effect, the washi tape and stickers I use are really personal for me because often they were gifts from friends!
        So when I use them, I receive a warm nostalgic feeling that keeps me going through stress.
        You can never know when stress is going to happen, so a positive, cheerful, and visually-appealing layout is like a magic spell from the past that shields me during future stress.
    </ul>
    <h2>Quantitative Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        This table, created with simple Python code, shows the data from the scanned pages.
        To make the table I simply hand-tallied the symbols on each page, entered them into a spreadsheet, converted that spreadsheet to a csv, and analyzed it with Pandas.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Total Objectives per Week</b>
            <br>What is particularly interesting to me is the drastic imbalance of obligations between weeks 6 and 7.
            As these are the weeks directly preceding midterm, this doesn't surprise me that week 7 would have so many tasks.
            Throughout my time at the university, I was acutely aware of certain professors using a "wheat from chaff" technique that was shocking to some students.
            Time management is one way to prevent this technique from having its desired effect.
            By carefully planning my obligations and known stressors, I limit the number of "dreaded variables".
            This is especially important for me as a person who also struggles to keep my human body in optimal operating condition.
            Stress impacts the body as well as the mind, and I was determined not to let last-minute changes, made by third parties, impact either one of these spheres.
        </li>
        <li><b>Total Objectives for Full 14 Weeks: 422</b>
            <br>Wow, that feels great! What a victory. Often during this final stretch of my academic journey I felt myself as a hound pulling at the lead, eager to leap past the limits of my master. I feel very strongly that this eagerness for the end is what kept me hungry to complete my work.
        </li>
        <li><b>Average Objectives for Full 14 Weeks: 38.5</b>
            <br>
            Seeing this from a different angle, averaging approximately 6 obligations per day (including weekends, of course) seems entirely manageable. As a student, it becomes worse when you don't work on the weekends (about 8 tasks per day!). It's important to have at least one day per week that you're not doing schoolwork, so that's approximately 7 tasks per day on average.

            Yet, recalling the seedling method discussed earlier, it is inaccurate to view these as 7 full tasks daily, but rather incremental progress on a task's total workload each day. Spending a minimum of 15 minutes on any task accumulates progress steadily. This approach is particularly vital with concurrent final projects alongside regular coursework.

            I advocate for tackling work in "little bites" daily, which, over time, amounts to substantial accomplishments while forestalling the dread that can accompany required work. For the aforementioned term paper requiring 8 hours of work, consistently investing 15 minutes per day  could hypothetically yield 56 completed items in the bujo invested toward that project, providing a more realistic perspective on meaningful work.
        </li>
        <figure class="project-img-small">

        </figure>
        <li><b>Total Moved Objectives: 72</b>
            <br>Looking at the week with the most moved items, Week 7 with a <i>Sunset over a Medieval Castle</i> motif,
            It is important to note that Week 7 was also my Spring Break in which I had no classes.
            I was thrilled to capitalize on this opportunity to get as much work done on my semester projects as possible,
            as I was not required to waste time commuting or endure lengthy orated lectures.
            With that in mind, I acknowledge that the way I work best is to assign myself an obligation in my bujo as soon as it is assigned by the professor.
            For instance, Week 7's Monday reflects "Eng reading" and looking at the course panel, that reading was Robbins 16, parts 1 & 2.
            Looking further down in the week, I am able to see this obligation was moved to Week 7's Wednesday, where it was completed.

        <li><b>Total Eliminated Objectives: 45</b>
            <br>As mentioned previously, an item may be eliminated due to cancellation or a superseding event rendering it obsolete.
            It appears that Week 8 had the most eliminated events. Investigating this page, I can see that it is due to assignments being moved or canceled,
            study sessions being canceled until later dates, or assignments being completed before the scheduled obligation occurred.
            When assigning myself obligations in my bujo, I often project out multiple work sessions throughout the week.
            Therefore, when I completed "Asgn 3" on Week 8's Tuesday, I was able to eliminate its subsequent "little bite" scheduled for Thursday.
            The Friday's "Asgn 3" is absolutely an indicator that this is when I sent the assignment's electronic file to the course server, as I recognize my technique here.

    <h2>Insights as to Design Influences on Productivity</h2>
    <p>
        It is so important to me, for keeping my mood positive, to have a bujo layout that reflects my hopes for that timeframe. The bujo lays open on my desk nearly all the time, and two adjacent pages reflect a two-week sprint with a common color scheme. Looking more closely at Week 10 and 11, which appeared side by side, we can see this effect more clearly. I remember that during this time, I felt the sensation of wanting the semester to be over so sharply. The washi tape with cloud motif is one of my favorites and I felt during this time I needed the reassurance of that positive image. The <i>Beach Sand and Tide Waters</i> color theme was intended to remind me to feel calm.

        Reflecting on my bujo experiences for my 14-week semester affords me fond memories as well.
        Note also the little symbol of the Solar Eclipse on Week 10's Monday (appearing just above the date digit). I thank myself for having my work done ahead of time so that I could request to be excused from classes that day, allowing full enjoyment of that moment! Other notes in these pages (Week 10's Thursday, for instance) recall for me the wonderful brunches I would often enjoy with my friend and remind me how necessary and precious intentional breaks are during long stretches of difficult academic work.

    <h3>Experience Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        It has been such a delightful and rewarding process to glance back through the content of my bujo companion over the previous 14 weeks. This planning tool has been a significant contributor to my success in the final stretch of my university degree program. I feel confident in saying that I could not have been successful or have met my personal standards of excellence without this tool, something that is both my creation as well as my assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
        My bullet journal is more than just a planner; it is a guide for goal-setting, a clerk of the challenges I faced and overcame, and scribe of my achievements and points of pride.
    </p>
    <p>
        The bujo's role in my academic journey serves as an example of the importance of finding a personally and functionally resonant system for time management. For me, it reflects how visualization can transform into tangible results. Going forward, I will continue to carry with me the value of retaining past page series, as well as translating my insights to support my endeavors beyond university life.
