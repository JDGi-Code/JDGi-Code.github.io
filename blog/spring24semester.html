    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        The heart of bullet journaling, or bujo, is to find a rhythm within one’s life patterns.
        The rhythm helps me to understand my motivations and approach problems in ways that are most effective for the way I see the world.
        This project examines my faithful bujo companion, through a 14-week senior semester at UMass Amherst.
        This endeavor is a voyage into the sea of my daily responsibilities and dreams, where rigid organization meets colorful expression.
        As a devoted bujo practitioner, I embark on this journey to sift through the sand of my weekly needfuls to reveal the hidden gems within my pages, embedded in my daily planning habits.
        Understanding the strengths of weaknesses of my personal planning may enhance my approach to time management and possibly offer interesting insights for others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bujo is special to me because I credit this tool as being instrumental in helping me to overcome personal obstacles and achieve my personal standards of excellence.
        I fully believe that anyone can benefit from bujo techniques, which are infinite in variety and purpose.
        This project may be of interest to time management enthusiasts and bujo practitioners interested in the techniques, and their outcomes.
        By analyzing and sharing my experience, I hope to make the connection with students and bujo enthusiasts, to facilitate our collective journey toward more satisfying productivity.
    </p>
    <h2>Research Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>How many total objectives did I set each week, and what’s the average weekly obligation count?</li>
        <li>How many objectives were deferred to future dates, and why?</li>
        <li>Which weeks had the highest procrastination rates, and what were the underlying reasons?</li>
        <li>How many objectives were completely eliminated from my schedule?</li>
        <li>What can be learned from the design elements used in my bujo?</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Resources Used</h2>
    <p>
        A big part of our bujo community online is sharing supplies used for one's process.
        Largely owing to bujo's kinesthetic learning benefit, supplies are highly personal to the bujo enthusiast, as they become the artist's tools for creating the desired effect.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
        My bujo pages were created on A5 6-hole punched dot grid paper.
        This paper is somewhat glossy, with low tooth, therefore a Sharpie fine-point (0.4 mm) black felt tip pen is exclusively used.
        The 0.4mm Sharpie pen dries quickly and rarely smudges on this paper.
        However this pen is too fine to write on the washi tape itself, so for that I used a standard Sharpie fine-point marker.
        To decorate the pages, I use Mt brand washi tape and other novelty washi tape from miscellaneous brands.
    </p>
    <h2>Methodology & Exploration</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Page Scanning: Digital copies of 14 weeks of bujo entries.</li>
        <li>Data Cleaning: Ensuring privacy by redacting sensitive information.</li>
        <li>Qualitative Analysis: Identifying symbols, colors, and design elements.</li>
        <li>Quantitative Analysis: Tracking task completion rates, instances of procrastination, and overall productivity.</li>
        <li>Effectiveness: Reflecting on how well my methods supported my work and goals.</li>
    </ul>
    <figure class="project-img-v-small">
        <img src="images/week4.png" alt="Week 4 of 14.">
        <figcaption class="caption">Standardized weekly layout format used throughout.</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2>Page Scanning: Form & Technique</h2>
    <p>
        The weekly bujo layout I use, with a Sunday start, I developed by trial and error over the years.
        It has worked best for me to manage both types of collegiate semester needfuls, including my course obligations and associated daily obligations.
        On one side of the page is a strip of weekdays, from Sunday to Saturday.
        This side reflects the week number out of 14 total weeks, the day of the week as a letter (S, M, T, W, T, F, S), and the day’s associated calendar date.
        The opposite side holds all my courses, in this case denoted by their university codes (OIM 350, ENG 391C, SOC 313, and INFO 490PI).
        The pages are decorated with stickers and colors that I believed would foster energy and motivation required for the daunting task of completing my final semester at UMass Amherst on a high note.
        I create these pages well in advance of the week taking place; in the case of this project, I created the outline of the weeks (the 'skeletons') before the semester began.
        This helped me keep a rhythm as I wasn't required to create weekly layouts in the middle of a workflow.
    </p>
    <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
    <p>
        After scanning the pages, I loaded the images into Adobe Creative Cloud and cleaned up artifacts left over from the scanner, including black streaks that appeared sometimes in the middle of the pages.
        I also added black lines to redact areas where necessary. These items include the names of people and locations, projects that are in confidential stages, and other private items.
        In this case, it is deemed more important to retain the status of the obligation rather than what the item or event was <i>(see Symbol Identification)</i>.
    </p>
    <h2>Qualitative Analysis</h2>
    <h3>Symbol Identification</h3>
    <figure class="project-img-tiny">
        <img src="images/bujosymbols.png" alt="Symbols used in the bujo project.">
        <figcaption class="caption">Symbols used in the bujo project.</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <ul>
        <li>Filled Circle: Indicates an objective that was completed within the specified deadline.
            If on the date, this objective was completed on that date.
            If within the courses panel, this objective was completed before the week was over or on/before its indicated deadline.
            In some cases, obligations appear simultaneously within the courses panel and the weekly panel within the same week.
            This is due to acknowledgement that the obligation has a deadline for that week, as well as my personal goal-setting of a deadline to complete that weekly needful on a designated date.
        </li>
        <li>Arrow in Circle: Indicates this objective was moved to a different date, in the direction the arrow is pointing.
            For example, an arrow pointing right (as in image) indicates this item was pushed forward to another future date.
            Arrows may also point up, down, or left, indicating the objective was moved earlier or later in the same week.
            In rare cases, the arrow may take a different form than this image, such as a typical line with a bracket.
        </li>
        <li>
            Crossed-Out Circle: Indicates this objective was eliminated completely from the list of tasks.
            There may be many reasons for this, such as event cancellation or a superseding event causing this obligation to become obsolete.
        </li>
        <li>
            Other symbols: Redactions have been made to preserve privacy and appear as solid black lines obscuring the event details.
            Some items may also be highlighted in vibrant yellow crayon, indicating obligations that are of the utmost priority and with deadlines that cannot be altered.
        </li>
    <h3>Design Elements</h3>
        Plodding through the final semester of my 4-year university foray was daunting.
        I had often heard of Senior Burnout and I was steadfastly determined not to fall victim to such a thing.
        Something that I believe is key to warding off energy drain is surrounding oneself with positive peripheral ambience.
        For instance, colors, sounds, scents, and textures that improve one's quality of life on a subconscious level and inevitably cause higher improved vibrations on the conscious level.
        Taking for instance Weeks 8 and 9 that appear together when the bujo is opened flat, this cheerful pastel theme was specially designed to get me through the midterms.
        In addition to selecting color combinations that will produce a pleasing visual effect, the washi tape and stickers I use are really personal for me because often they were gifts from friends!
        So when I use them, I receive a warm nostalgic feeling that keeps me going through stress.
        You can never know when stress is going to happen, so a positive, cheerful, and visually-appealing layout is like a magic spell from the past that shields me during future stress.
    </ul>
    <h2>Quantitative Analysis</h2>
    <figure class="project-img-small">
        <img src="images/bujoTable.png" alt="A table of the data set.">
        <figcaption class="caption">A table of the data set created using Pandas.</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        This table, created with simple Python code, shows the data from the scanned pages.
        To make the table I simply hand-tallied the symbols on each page, entered them into a spreadsheet, converted that spreadsheet to a csv, and analyzed it with Pandas.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The total objectives per week are displayed within the table above.
            What is particularly interesting to me is the drastic imbalance of obligations between weeks 6 and 7.
            As these are the weeks directly preceding midterm, this doesn't surprise me that week 7 would have so many tasks.
            Throughout my time at the university, I was acutely aware of certain professors using a "wheat from chaff" technique that was shocking to some students.
            Time management is one way to prevent this technique from having its desired effect.
            By carefully planning my obligations and known stressors, I limit the number of "dreaded variables".
            This is especially important for me as a person who also struggles to keep my human body in optimal operating condition.
            Stress impacts the body as well as the mind, and I was determined not to let last-minute changes, made by third parties, impact either one of these spheres.
        </li>
        <li>Total Objectives for Full 14 Weeks: 422
            <br>Wow, that feels great! What a victory.
            Often during this final stretch of my academic journey I felt myself as a hound pulling at the lead, eager to pull past the limits of my master.
            I feel very strongly that this eagerness for the end is what kept me hungry to complete my work.
        </li>
        <li>Average Objectives for Full 14 Weeks: 38.5
            <br>
            Seeing this from a different angle, averaging approximately 6 obligations per day (including weekends, of course) seems entirely manageable.
            As a student, it becomes worse when you don't work on the weekends (about 8 tasks per day!).
            It's important to have at least one day per week that you're not doing schoolwork, so that's approximately 7 tasks per day on average.
            However, a critical perspective to keep in mind is the way that I manage tasks.
            It would be inaccurate to claim I am completing 7 full tasks each day.
            Rather, I am usually completing 15 minutes of any given task's total workload - at minimum - each day until the item is complete.
            For instance, a term paper is one task, but may take 8 weeks to complete.
            All four of my courses this semester included substantial 'final projects' running concurrent to the weekly required coursework.
            For me, the only way to accomplish meaningful work is to proceed in "little bites" consisting of at least 15 minutes of work each day.
            These 15-minute little bites often extend to an hour of work at a time, but obligating myself to only 15-minute bites forestalls my sense of dread about required work.
            Working 15 minutes each day at this single task amounts to a hypothetical 56 completed items in the bujo, and is a more realistic viewpoint of what meaningful work entails.
        </li>
        <figure class="project-img-small">
            <img src="images/week6-7.png" alt="Weeks 6 and 7 side by side.">
            <figcaption class="caption">A side-by-side view of Weeks 6 & 7.</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <li>Total Moved Objectives: 72
            <br>Looking at the week with the most moved items, Week 7 with a <i>Sunset over a Medieval Castle</i> motif,
            It is important to note that Week 7 was also my Spring Break in which I had no classes.
            I was thrilled to capitalize on this opportunity to get as much work done on my semester projects as possible,
            as I was not required to waste time commuting or endure lengthy orated lectures.
            With that in mind, I acknowledge that the way I work best is to assign myself an obligation in my bujo as soon as it is assigned by the professor.
            For instance, Week 7's Monday reflects "Eng reading" and looking at the course panel, that reading was Robbins 16, parts 1 & 2.
            Looking further down in the week, I am able to see this obligation was moved to Week 7's Wednesday, where it was completed.
            Effective time management includes mindful procrastination: Pivoting one's intentions with realistic expectations of future promises.
        </li>
        <li>Total Eliminated Objectives: 45
            <br>As mentioned previously, an item may be eliminated due to cancellation or a superseding event rendering it obsolete.
            It appears that Week 8 had the most eliminated events. Investigating this page, I can see that it is due to assignments being moved or canceled,
            study sessions being canceled until later dates, or assignments being completed before the scheduled obligation occurred.
            When assigning myself obligations in my bujo, I often project out multiple work sessions throughout the week.
            Therefore, when I completed "Asgn 3" on Week 8's Tuesday, I was able to eliminate its subsequent "little bite" scheduled for Thursday.
            The Friday's "Asgn 3" is absolutely an indicator that this is when I sent the assignment's electronic file to the course server, as I recognize my technique here.

    <h2>Insights as to Design Influences on Productivity</h2>
    <p>
        It is so important to me, for keeping my mood positive, to have a bujo layout that reflects my hopes for that timeframe.
        The bujo lays open on my desk nearly all the time, and two adjacent pages reflect a two-week sprint with a common color scheme.
        Looking more closely at Week 10 and 11, which appeared side by side, we can see this effect more clearly.
        I remember that during this time, I felt the sensation of wanting the semester to be over so sharply.
        The washi tape with cloud motif is one of my favorites and I felt during this time I needed the reassurance of that positive image.
        The <i>Beach Sand and Tide Waters</i> color theme was intended to remind me to feel calm.
        <br>
        Reflecting on my bujo experiences for my 14-week semester affords me fond memories as well.
        Note also the little symbol of the Solar Eclipse on Week 10's Monday (appearing just above the date digit).
        How fortunate was I that classes were cancelled that day, allowing me to fully enjoy that moment!
        Recalling the wonderful brunches I would often enjoy with my friend, which occurred during Week 10's Thursday, reminds me of how necessary and precious are the intentional breaks we take to connect with friends during long stretches of difficult academic work.
