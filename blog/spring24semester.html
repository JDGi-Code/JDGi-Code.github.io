    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        The heart of bullet journaling, or bujo, is to find a rhythm within one’s life patterns.
        The rhythm helps me to understand my motivations and approach problems in ways that are most effective for the way I see the world.
        This project examines my faithful bujo companion, through a 14-week senior semester at UMass Amherst.
        This endeavor is a voyage into the sea of my daily responsibilities and dreams, where rigid organization meets colorful expression.
        As a devoted bujo practitioner, I embark on this journey to sift through the sand of my weekly needfuls to reveal the hidden gems within my pages, embedded in my daily planning habits.
        Understanding the strengths of weaknesses of my personal planning may enhance my approach to time management and possibly offer interesting insights for others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bujo is special to me because I credit this tool as being instrumental in helping me to overcome personal obstacles and achieve my personal standards of excellence.
        I fully believe that anyone can benefit from bujo techniques, which are infinite in variety and purpose.
        This project may be of interest to time management enthusiasts and bujo practitioners interested in the techniques, and their outcomes.
        By analyzing and sharing my experience, I hope to make the connection with students and bujo enthusiasts, to facilitate our collective journey toward more satisfying productivity.
    </p>
    <h2>Resources</h2>

        <figcaption class="caption">Product images for supplies used in this project.</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        These bujo pages were created on A5 6-hole punched dot grid paper.
        This paper is somewhat glossy, with low tooth, therefore a Sharpie fine-point (0.4 mm) black felt tip pen is exclusively used.
        To decorate the pages, I use Mt brand washi tape and other novelty washi tape from miscellaneous brands.
    </p>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Page Scanning: Digital copies of 14 weeks of bujo entries.</li>
        <li>Redaction: Ensuring privacy by redacting sensitive information.</li>
        <li>Qualitative Analysis: Identifying symbols, colors, and design elements.</li>
        <li>Quantitative Analysis: Tracking task completion rates, instances of procrastination, and overall productivity.</li>
        <li>Effectiveness: Reflecting on how well my methods supported my work and goals.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Symbol Identification</h2>
    <figure class="project-img-v-small">
        <img src="images/bujosymbols.png" alt="Symbols used in the bujo project.">
        <figcaption class="caption">Symbols used in the bujo project.</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <ul>
        <li>Filled Circle: Indicates an objective that was completed within the specified deadline.
            If on the date, this objective was completed on that date.
            If within the courses panel, this objective was completed before the week was over or on/before its indicated deadline.
            In some cases, obligations appear simultaneously within the courses panel and the weekly panel within the same week.
            This is due to acknowledgement that the obligation has a deadline for that week, as well as my personal goal-setting of a deadline to complete that weekly needful on a designated date.
        </li>
        <li>Arrow in Circle: Indicates this objective was moved to a different date, in the direction the arrow is pointing.
            For example, an arrow pointing right (as in image) indicates this item was pushed forward to another future date.
            Arrows may also point up, down, or left, indicating the objective was moved earlier or later in the same week.
            In rare cases, the arrow may take a different form than this image, such as a typical line with a bracket.
        </li>
        <li>
            Crossed-Out Circle: Indicates this objective was eliminated completely from the list of tasks.
            There may be many reasons for this, such as event cancellation or a superseding event causing this obligation to become obsolete.
        </li>
        <li>
            Additionally, redactions have been made to preserve privacy and appear as solid black lines obscuring the event details.
            Some items may also be highlighted in vibrant yellow crayon, indicating obligations that are of the utmost priority and with deadlines that cannot be altered.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Form & Technique</h2>
    <p>
        The weekly bujo layout I use, with a Sunday start, I developed by trial and error over the years.
        It has worked best for me to manage both types of collegiate semester needfuls, including my course obligations and associated daily obligations.
        On one side of the page is a strip of weekdays, from Sunday to Saturday.
        This side reflects the week number out of 14, the day of the week as a letter, and the day’s associated calendar date.
        The opposite side holds all my courses, in this case denoted by their university codes (OIM 350, ENG 391C, SOC 313, and INFO 490PI).
        The pages are decorated with stickers and colors that I believed would foster energy and motivation required for the daunting task of completing my final semester at UMass Amherst on a high note.
    </p>




    <h2>Exploration</h2>

    <p>
        Through this process I hope to uncover the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>How many total objectives did I have each week, and total for the full 14 weeks?
            What is the average weekly obligation count?</li>
        <li>How many total objectives were pushed forward to future dates?</li>
        <li>What weeks have the most procrastinated obligations and why might that be?</li>
        <li>How many total objectives were eliminated entirely from my weekly needfuls?</li>
        <li>What insights can be gained from consciously-curated design elements that have been used?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        My belief is that uncovering these details will provide very interesting insights into my daily time management practices.
    </p>
