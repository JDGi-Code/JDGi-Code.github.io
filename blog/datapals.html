        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            This research seeks to explore the effect of sleep on four chosen performance areas: productivity, stress resilience, alertness, and overall energy. As college students who are academically-focused, we were interested in this health data to gain insight into how sleep can be leveraged to help us meet our academic goals. Individually, we have different sleep habits and needs, which allows us to explore this health data through different lenses.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Research Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>How does the overall sleep data correlate with these four performance areas?</li>
            <li>How does sleep schedule consistency impact these four performance areas?</li>
            <li>How does sleep duration affect the performance outcomes differently?</li>
            <li>Do external factors (exams, stress at home, health issues) impact our performance or sleep?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>   
            These research questions have evolved for specificity and focus. We define "consistent" as maintaining a similar sleep duration across at least three consecutive days. Therefore, inconsistent sleep schedules must be the opposite - random durations, and without consistency. By examining the differences in outcomes between these two types of sleep schedules, we hope to gain understanding of the performance benefit of consistent sleep.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Sources</h3>
        <p>
            Two data streams were collected: Automatic sleep data tracked by our PI devices nightly, and manually recorded performance metrics. Each of the following were tracked daily:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Productivity: A personal feeling of having completed obligations, tasks, or achieving goals, measured by output (completed tasks within a given timeframe) or outcome (evaluates the quality of the output).</li>
            <li>Stress resilience: Ability to cope with/bounce back from stressful situations, measured by assessing emotional mood (ie confidence, optimism, etc).</li>
            <li>Alertness: Capacity to concentrate on routine tasks and remain attentive to responsibilities (remembering appointments, being alert throughout the day, etc). It is acknowledged that natural attention span rarely exceeds 10 minutes and "zoning out" to a certain degree is a normal part of daily life.</li>
            <li>Overall Energy: General level of vitality and physical/mental stamina for a given day (willingness to take on unplanned tasks, ease of moving from one task to another, general sense of fatigue).</li>
        </ul>
        <figure class="project-img-small">

        </figure>
        <h3>Scale</h3>
        <p>
            These areas were measured using a scale from 1 to 5, reflecting personal feelings about each of these areas according to the individual researcher.
        </p>
        <h4>Productivity:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Very low - Unable to accomplish any tasks.</li>
            <li>2 Low - Accomplished some tasks slowly and with effort.</li>
            <li>3 Moderate - Accomplished baseline tasks required for the day</li>
            <li>4 High - Met most obligations with a feeling of motivation</li>
            <li>5 Peak - Every goal for the day was eagerly met and completed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Stress Resilience:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Very low - Feeling overwhelmed by stress highly impacting mood.</li>
            <li>2 Low - Easily overwhelmed by minor challenges</li>
            <li>3 Moderate - Mood remains fairly stable for the majority of the day</li>
            <li>4 High - Able to calmly address challenging stressful situations.</li>
            <li>5 Peak - Positive mood when confronted with daily stressors.</li>
        </ul>    
        <h4>Alertness:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Very low - Easily distracted, struggling to remain engaged.</li>
            <li>2 Low - Somewhat easily distracted, difficult to maintain focus.</li>
            <li>3 Moderate - Can concentrate on tasks with occasional attention lapse.</li>
            <li>4 High - Feeling attentive and focused with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>5 Peak - Super sharp and focused, quick & efficient mental processing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Overall Energy:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Very low - Difficult to concentrate or engage; lethargic.</li>
            <li>2 Low - Tired, low enthusiasm or motivation, but performing basic tasks.</li>
            <li>3 Moderate - Completing daily tasks but with fatigue or and needing breaks.</li>
            <li>4 High - Motivated and able to complete tasks with focus.</li>
            <li>5 Peak - Super enthusiastic to tackle all the tasks for the day.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>            
            Our group chose to record performance metrics in two ways: Use of manual tracking in a weekly digital document, and optionally via a creative bullet journal (bujo) page. Those who chose the bujo method had the opportunity to personally engage with the data, and will further reflect on how this format enhanced their research experience.
        </p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <h3>Data Collection Process & Comprehensive Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            Gathering data allows us to explore the link between sleep and performance variables. By visually analyzing this data, we aim to uncover correlations. Examining the impact of sleep consistency on performance helps us understand its effects. Comparing our findings determines if consistent sleep truly enhances specific performance areas. Studying the relationship between sleep duration and wellbeing can reveal optimal sleep patterns for performance maximization. Recognizing confounding variables like exams, stress, and health issues is key to understanding how our lifestyles influence our performance. Join us as we delve into our research to discover the benefits of structured sleep schedules. Take a moment to pause and reflect alongside us on our outcomes, and consider what you yourself might do to take action to improve your sleep for optimizing your daily performance.
        </p>
        <h3>Limitations of Data Collection Approach for Accurate Answers</h3>
        <p>
            Environmental Factors: Although stimuli like noise and living space differences can affect sleep quality and/or performance outcomes, our data does not account for these environmental influences, and that may introduce bias into our results.
            <br>Manual Data Entry: Manually-recorded performance data introduces a risk of human error, though we endeavored to be accurate as possible in this regard.
            <br>Subjectivity of Data: Due to the personal nature of our own performance assessments, quantification of performance data will vary from person to person.
            <br>Device Reliability: Battery failure and data synchronization problems may lead to missing or incomplete data, possibly affecting the accuracy of the analysis.
            <br>Data Limitations: Our study includes a small group of college students, which restricts the generalizability of the findings. Our results may not apply to a broader audience of researchers doing similar studies, however the personal nature of our findings provides some latitude in this regard.
            <br>Brief Duration: The data collection period of 6 weeks may be insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. A longer study may provide for a more robust analysis. With this in mind, we regard our research as an exploratory undertaking, rather than being solely outcomes-focused.
        </p>    
        <h2>Data Pipeline</h2>
        <h3>Collection, Extraction, and Analysis Procedure</h3>
        <p>
            Performance data, collected manually using a common template, were ranked on a scale of 1 to 5. We included any comments related to our personal circumstances affecting our performance as we saw fit. Automated sleep data, collected with our PI tracking devices, was exported to CSV files at the end of the collection period. Using Python Pandas, the data was combined and cleaned to prepare for analysis.
        </p>
            <!-- # Data Cleaning Procedure
            import pandas as pd
            # Read the csv files
            df1 = pd.read_csv('jgTracker.csv')
            df2 = pd.read_csv('jgSleep.csv')
            # Drop first column of sleep log - a primary key for the sleep log entry
            df2 = df2.drop(df2.columns[0], axis=1)
            # Standardize timestamps
            # Convert the 'timestamp' column to datetime object
            df1['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df1['timestamp'])
            df2['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df2['timestamp'])
            # Change the 'timestamp' column to 'MM/DD/YYYY'format
            df1['timestamp'] = df1['timestamp'].dt.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
            df2['timestamp'] = df2['timestamp'].dt.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
            # Merge the two dataframes on a common column
            data = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='timestamp')
            # Save the merged dataframe to a new csv file
            data.to_csv('jgData.csv', index=False) -->
        <h3>Summary of Data Cleaning Process</h3>
        <p>
            Because our team used both AppleWatches and Pixel devices, the sleep tracking information formats were not consistent. AppleWatch's XML format and sleep duration in hours and minutes conflicted with Pixel's CSV format and duration (formatted as a two-digit 'sleep score'). Consequently, we needed a solution to standardize the formats before analysis. We changed the scope of Research Question 2 to focus on sleep duration in minutes, supported by both device types, and arranged our data as CSVs with a common structure with six columns: Observation date, four performance areas (productivity, stress resilience, alertness and overall energy) and sleep duration in total minutes. This allowed for consistency and eased the process of preparing the data for analysis.
        </p>
        <h3>Evolution of our Research Endeavor</h3>
        <p>
            As none of us had ever tracked sleep in this way before this endeavor, there were things learned through trial and error and supported successful data collection. First, we didn't realize we needed to set alarms for AppleWatch to track sleep data, and therefore set alarms each day, including weekends, to ensure data consistency. It also became apparent that it was important to set a consistent daily time to track performance. At first, we recorded performance metrics at random times of day, but after discussion considered this may bias our results. Therefore, we also set device reminders to ensure manual data collection consistency as well.

        <h2>Insights</h2>
        <figure class="project-img-small">
            <img src="images/datapalsBujoVis1.png" alt="Data Tracker in a Bujo Style by JG">
            <figcaption class="caption">JG's bujo visualizations: Intermediate (right) and complete (left)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            J.D. Gi: Using conventions recommended by the online bujo community, I created this tracker for visualizing my performance and sleep. The sleep overlay is a sheet of semi-transparent vellum, allowing the color blocks to show through. Although mathematical precision is absent from the hand-drawn diagram, it is clear that I rarely achieve the full 8 hours of sleep that is customarily viewed as a standard of "good rest." Upon reflection on this, I feel it is important for me to implement lifestyle changes that would allow for more dedicated time for sleep.
            <br>
            I felt the process of creating the visualization was highly therapeutic. While maintaining the manual log daily, I completed the colorblocks weekly rather than daily to minimize my own bias. I looked forward to filling in my color blocks each week, and felt satisfaction when I saw the 10-day streak of blue for "productivity". It's easy to spot that two of my "blue ribbon" days, in which I scored 5 in all performance areas, were my highest and lowest sleep durations, which seems contradictory. Whenever I filled in an orange "2", I consciously reflected on external factors that had impacted those areas when otherwise I might have had better performance. Reflecting on these things, concurrent to data collection, helped me gain a more holistic understanding of the research overall, and lent to faster formulation of final conclusions. It was gratifying to complete the circle grid, and it helped me to remain mindful of the timeline that remained. I believe this prevented me from being influenced by frustration and burnout. It also helped me to gain a preliminary understanding of what the computer analysis would reflect, which helped me consider options in advance of that undertaking. I plan to make use of the insights I have gained by making more time for restful sleep. For instance, my belief is that I can reserve one hour before bedtime for cessation of screen time and low-light, relaxing activities such as drinking herbal tea alongside light reading, to facilitate easier transition to sleep.

        </figure>
        <p>
            Kate: Throughout the six week duration of this data collection process, my most favorite part of the process was the bullet journal visualization. It is not often that I get to interact with one of my hobbies as a part of a course-related assignment and I am very grateful for this opportunity. Although there is very little critical analysis that occurs when I fill in the four squares for each performance metric at the end of each night, it is a great piece of reflection. As the weeks progressed, seeing all of the different colored blocks lined up on the same piece of paper forces me to stop every night and reflect on my time and my actions. For example, all of my metrics have varied greatly depending on the day, and it is much easier for me to visualize these variations with the color representation compared to the numbers in a table on my performance tracker document. Through the bullet journal aspect of this project, I have found that I have been sleeping better in general, and I think that this is partly due to forcing myself to sit down, reflect and interact with the bujo page each night. Overall, I am very pleased with the outcomes from my bujo page as a part of this tracking process.
        </p>
        <h3>Q1: Analysis of Overall Data</h3>
        <figure class="project-img-small">
            <img src="images/datapalsOverallData.png" alt="Overall data in four plots">
            <figcaption class="caption">Overall performance metrics and duration for all four researchers.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            These plots provide a big picture look at the data we have collected over the past 6 weeks, broken down by metric tracked with separate colors for each researcher. The y-axis for each graph ranges from 0–600 minutes of sleep and the x-axis ranges from 1–5 for each metric except for alertness, which ranges from 2–5 because no group members reported a 1 in that category. Each point represents the rating of a specific metric after how many minutes of sleep the group member got the previous night. The data is clearly varied for each group member and between group members. For example, it seems as though JG and Tanvi got less sleep (in minutes), on average, than Kate and Rauzat. Overall, each metric did not yield a highly significant trend for every group member, as we may have expected. Judging from this data, it is clear that a longer study is needed to determine any significant correlations between sleep and our chosen metrics.
            <br>
            While we see evidence of sleep habits having an individualized impact, it also reflects the subjective nature of our performance scores. JG did not record anything below a 2 for the duration of the research period. This could skew results slightly, and further research may benefit from less subjective data collection. For instance, instead of each individual recording their personal perspectives, an interviewer could ask about performance metrics and probe for more details before recording data on the 1–5 scale.
            <br>
            With regard to data combining challenges, due to the fact that the data frames were equal in number of rows and columns, and each frames' columns maintained a consistent naming convention, the data combined seamlessly.
        </p>
        <h3>Vega Visualization</h3>
        <p>
            Our Vega visualization uses the Altair library to show the relationship between sleep duration and a composite score of performance. Each researcher is represented with a different color to distinguish data points, and additional details about each data point are accessible through interactive tooltips that display upon hovering.
        </p>
        <figure class="project-img-small">

        </figure>
        <p>
            Insights and Interpretations of Individual Researchers:
            <ul>
                <li>JG: Points heavily cluster between 400-500 mins. It can be observed that this participant's performance metrics are also higher around 500 minutes of sleep. This suggests that around 500 minutes is her optimal sleep duration.</li>
                <li>Kate: It can be observed that moderate performance metrics are prevalent across wide ranges of sleep duration. However, around 400 mins Kate's overall performance tends to be slightly higher.</li>
                <li>Rauzat: Data points are highly scattered with huge numbers being clustered around 200-300 mins. The performance metrics, however, are quite variable.</li>
                <li>Tanvi: The data has a huge concentration of data points around 400-600 mins. The performance metrics during the given sleep duration are moderately high. However, the metrics are still highly variable.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <figure class="project-img-small">
            <img src="images/datapalsVega2.png" alt="Individual scatterplots with Vega Altair">
            <figcaption class="caption">A look at the individualized data using Vega Altair.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Overall Insights and Interpretation:
            <ul>
                <li>JG shows some positive correlation between sleep duration and other performance metrics, but the other participants don't show any significant trends.</li>
                <li>There is high variability in sleep duration and overall performance metrics for all four participants.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Q2: Evidence of Benefits of Consistent Sleep</h3>
        <figure class="project-img-small">
            <img src="images/datapalsConsistencyData.png" alt="Consistency data in four plots">
            <figcaption class="caption">Evidence of consistency and inconsistency within performance segments.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Based on analysis of each researcher's sleep and performance data, the benefits of consistent sleep vary depending on the person. In JG's analysis, it is clear that sleep consistency is absent, so has no effect on her performance. On the other hand, Rauzat's performance data is relatively consistent with her sleep duration, particularly in the second half of the data collection period, so there is a correlation between sleep consistency and performance, particularly productivity.
            <br>
            For both Tanvi and Kate, there were some metrics which seemed to be contingent on sleep duration and others which weren't, but no evidence of consistency benefits. In general, each of these statements would be made more conclusive with a larger data collection period. However, these conclusions remain valid given the data that has been collected. Despite these variations in certain performance metrics between group members, stress resilience levels were very inconsistent for all four group members when compared to sleep duration. This is likely due to the number of outside factors which are involved in determining one's stress resilience levels. Overall, it is interesting to note how sleep duration is very individualized in how it benefits each member of our group.
            </p>
            <h4>Challenges in Achieving Consistent Sleep for 3+ Days in a Row</h4>
            <p>
            There were many unforeseen challenges with getting blocks of consistent sleep for at least three days in a row. A common issue for everyone in our group was the fact that Spring Break occurred early on in the data collection process. As such, all of our schedules were no longer consistent and a few of us went on vacation so flight times impacted our sleep consistency. Additionally, mental illness created challenges in maintaining a consistent sleep schedule. Depending on the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms, it was difficult for some of us to control when we went to bed and when we woke up on certain days. Also, one of our group members suffers from insomnia which also increases the difficulty of maintaining a consistent sleep duration. Beyond our personal circumstances, a varying workload makes it difficult to get consistent durations, as some days require more time dedicated to work and therefore being awake more time than others.
        </p>
        <h3>Q3: How Sleep Duration Impacts Specific Performance Areas</h3>
        <figure class="project-img-small">
            <img src="images/datapalsDurationData.png" alt="Duration trends for entire group">
            <figcaption class="caption">Duration trends by performance area, for all four researchers (by row).</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Each researcher's sleep duration reflects different lifestyle habits and these scatter plots indicate, ceteris paribus, sleep duration may impact performance in an individualist sense. Duration seems to have the most impact on three of the four performance areas (alertness, stress resilience, and energy). The plots for duration and each performance area show that three of four researchers have a similar trend line for alertness, stress resilience, and energy. Using the following scatterplot grid, with each column representing the full data set of a single researcher, we can get a closer look at how sleep duration impacts each performance area.
            <br>The visualizations above show the relationship between sleep duration and performance data. The Pearson coefficient, used to estimate the linear relationship between two quantitative measures, has been provided. This is more informative for our purposes than the t-test, which may be more appropriate for discovering which of the four variables is most significantly influenced by sleep. In this case, given the small data set and our purposes, Pearson is likely more useful. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Kate: Productivity is slightly negatively correlated to sleep duration (-0.183). For this researcher, it may be that a sense productivity is linked to something other than being 'well rested.' Alertness (0.113), however, had a slightly positive correlation, indicating more sleep helps them to achieve a higher level of focus. On the other hand, sleep didn't have any significant impact on their stress resilience (-0.014) and energy levels (-0.027)</li>
            <li>JG: Productivity (-0.062) is only slightly negatively correlated, and alertness (0.053) not significantly correlated, which indicates these variables are not meaningfully influenced by sleep duration. Sleep duration is slightly negatively correlated with stress resilience (-0.184), however more data would be needed to gain any meaningful insight. Overall energy (0.09) is slightly positively correlated, but not significantly. As overall sleep duration does not fluctuate significantly throughout the experiment, and the data is limited, it would be difficult to draw conclusions as to what this means for this individual, however stress resilience decreasing with more sleep may be influenced by external factors.</li>
            <li>Rauzat: Productivity (0.176) and energy ( 0.112) show a slight positive correlation with the sleep duration which indicates that a bit more sleep could slightly improve these areas. Stress resilience (-0.063) and alertness (0.037) do not show a significant correlation with sleep, suggesting that sleep duration didn't have any significant impact on the stress resilience and alertness. As there is only a slight correlation between sleep and all variables, more data would benefit the research to determine how sleep duration impacts performance for Rauzat.</li>
            <li>Tanvi: There's a slight negative correlation for productivity (-0.114) and alertness (-0.096),  meaning more sleep might make this individual feel sluggish. Again, the data set is small so this is a broad statement. Stress resilience (-0.473) shows a stronger negative correlation with sleep duration. This could mean that the individual sought more sleep as a result of stress, like an illness or other outside factor. Their energy (0.332) shows a stronger positive correlation with sleep, suggesting that more sleep leads to higher energy levels, which contradicts the results for stress resilience somewhat.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As most researchers' sleep duration trends differ overall by no more than 30 mins, more data is needed before any conclusions can be made. As these are trend analyses, the date labels associated with documented life events are not included. What we can see, however, is it's not as simple as 'more sleep equals better everything.' There is high contrast and individualism which imply that external factors impact the dependent variables and sleep duration alone might not statistically determine outcomes.

        <h3>Q4: Sentiment Analysis on Reflection Notes</h3>
        <figure class="project-img-small">

            <figcaption class="caption">Wordcloud made from reflection notes.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Sentiment analysis was performed on our reflection notes using the R package wordcloud2. First a word cloud was created with a frequency of 80 to reflect the most common words used in our reflections. Although some data scientists argue that word clouds are not the best tools for analysis, the image provides a helpful starting point to get an overview of our feelings during the research.
            <br>Given the brevity of our study, the quantity of textual notes was limited. To supplement our data set, reflections from our previous milestone were included to increase the wordcount to just under 1600 words. This low quantity made analysis somewhat difficult, as the notes also lacked depth of descriptive words and in some cases. Additionally, the English stopwords dictionary was supplemented with additional words to improve the wordcloud sample: "week", "sleep", "slept", "like", "bit", "day". A deeper look at our researcher notes can shine some light on where the most commonly-appearing words come from:
            <ul>
                <li>Mood: "I had a lot of wins this week that helped me keep my mood high… it seems this is determined more by encounters rather than amount of sleep"</li>
                <li>Stress: "I feel like there's never really a way to feel completely 'safe' from academic stress; as much as you try to control stress, you can never be sure what is going to happen."</li>
                <li>Consistent: "Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule has helped me to plan my day as I know the amount of time I need to be awake."</li>
                <li>Flight: "Had to wake up at 1:45 am to get on a flight … slept on a plane and then bed when I got there … adjusting to time change"</li>
                <li>Performance: "This week I felt for the first time the incredible realization that soon my time at UMass will be over. I believe this affected my performance areas overall this week in a highly positive way."</li>
                <li>Feel: "If anything, I feel as though my overall energy scores are most indicative of my sleep duration/quality as it has a direct effect on how I feel. As students we are required to meet deadlines whether we feel productive and energized or not, so my circumstances seem to affect my tracked metrics just as much as my sleep does."</li>
                <li>Energy: "Toward the end of the week, a sudden academic responsibility forced me to expend the last shred of energy."</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            These personal insights provide context for our considerations that occurred throughout the study about external stimuli including travel, positive encounters, classroom obligations, optimism, and time management. The insight we gain from this is that while sleep is a passive activity, there are many factors that contribute to quality other than that time the person physically enters and exits their state of sleeping. Due to this reality, it may be impossible to meaningfully curate the "optimum sleep schedule." Nevertheless, exploration of our recorded thoughts and feelings helped us to meaningfully consider how outside factors play a significant role in our performance from day to day, which may inform our behavior modifications, going forward.

        <h3>Experience Reflection</h3>
            <h4>Kate:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Expectations: I expected to forget to track my data each day or to have a hard time getting motivated to record my data daily, but the opposite happened. I ended up becoming very interested in the metrics involved in this project and I would look forward to my daily reflection on my performance and it added some structure to my day.</li>
                <li>Highlights: This project made me more aware of how sensitive I am to outside stressors in my life. Regardless of how much sleep I am able to get in a night, if there is a negative situation going on in my life, I have a very difficult time dealing with these emotions. This newfound awareness of this part of my personality was an important and unexpected finding to come out of this project for me.</li>
                <li>Positive outcome: In general, this project has made me more aware of my sleeping patterns and habits. Before this project, I was under the impression that I maintained a relatively consistent sleep schedule. However, it wasn't until I had to try and keep my sleep schedule consistent, and found myself inconvenienced by it, that I realized my sleep is not as consistent as I assumed. Due to this newfound awareness, I am going to continue to be more aware of my sleeping patterns and habits as a way to better my overall health and wellbeing.</li>
                <li>Negative outcome: I have not really been enjoying wearing my Apple Watch to sleep every evening. I find that it has become very uncomfortable and heavy to sleep with. While this has not affected my sleep or anything dramatic, it is just a minor inconvenience in my life that I am looking forward to not being required to do so anymore.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Tanvi:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Expectations: I expected to see some kind of positive correlation between sleep and other metrics, and that all of us would be more consistent with our sleep, but it was a good experience to know how hard it is to conduct a study and how important of a role data collection plays in a study.</li>
                <li>Highlights: I looked forward to noting down and reflecting on my metrics everyday and these helped to understand my schedules and quality of being better.</li>
                <li>Positive outcome: Like everyone else, being able to track my sleep and other metrics helped me better understand my everyday life and it was interesting to analyze them and get a quantitative measure.</li>
                <li>Negative outcome: I don't wear a watch when I'm sleeping so wearing it everyday for the last couple of weeks has been uncomfortable causing a little inconvenience to my sleep.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Rauzat:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Expectations: I expected to get kind of tired of tracking these health metrics, especially towards the end of this experiment. Although I dislike wearing my AppleWatch to bed, tracking these metrics have not been as tiresome as I thought and they do give me a chance to reflect about my day and my sleep.</li>
                <li>Highlights: I have really enjoyed reviewing my sleep metrics over this course of this project. It has been interesting to track metrics beyond just sleep duration like how much time I spent in each sleep cycle (even though we are not using that data for this project). I had never realized that I am often not meeting my sleep goal of 8 hours every night as I am often in bed for that amount of time but not asleep yet.</li>
                <li>Positive outcome: One of the positive outcomes of this experience has been that I am significantly more aware of my negative sleep habits and can work toward trying to maintain a more consistent schedule. I know that keeping a consistent sleep schedule and getting 8 hours of sleep every night is very important for my physical and mental wellbeing so this is definitely something that I want to work on.</li>
                <li>Negative outcome: The only negative impact from this sleep tracking has been the inconvenience of wearing my AppleWatch at night. I find it uncomfortable to sleep with and feel by my face every night. I also have been breaking out on my wrist from wearing my AppleWatch during the day and the night as my skin does not get a break. The other challenge for me has been finding a time to charge my AppleWatch adequately so that it does not die during the night. Previously, I would charge my AppleWatch during the night, but this time has been cut down to when I shower.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>J. G:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Expectations: I expected the research to be more complicated and more difficult than it ended up being. Once we had a plan, it was a straightforward process.</li>
                <li>Highlights: Creating the bujo page was my favorite part of this research. It was a good experience to inject one of my beloved hobbies into the endeavor, and I liked sharing that with my teammates.</li>
                <li>Positive outcome: I became more aware of how little sleep I get on a regular basis. Although I am not conscious of being sleep-deprived, I am conscious of how easily I am affected by stressors and I believe that it is possible that with more sleep, I could combat those stressors more effectively.</li>
                <li>Negative outcome: I was reluctant to continue wearing the device to bed for the full six weeks because I was concerned that I could develop an allergic reaction to the watch band, which has occurred in the past with similar devices. I had begun to conceptualize ways to maintain the data collection process if it did occur. Thankfully, it didn't happen that way.</li>
            </ul>
