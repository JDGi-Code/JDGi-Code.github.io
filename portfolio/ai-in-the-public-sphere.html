        <h2>Background & Context</h2>
        <p>
            The dataset used in the FiveThirtyEight story "Why We're Sharing 3 Million Russian Troll Tweets" comprised a
            total of 2,973,371 tweets from Twitter handles linked to the Russian "troll factory" called the Internet
            Research Agency.
            The original data set spanned November 2017 to June 2018, and was gathered by Clemson University researchers
            using custom searches on Social Studio, a firm owned by Salesforce.
        </p>
        <p>
            A selection of nearly 400,000 tweets were gathered from this original data set, and uploaded to Kaggle. The
            dataset includes active links, with caution advised. These selections were analyzed on multiple dimensions:
            Account holder language, account holder region, most common hashtags, and most common string terms. In the
            following pages, these dimensions are evaluated for meaning.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
        <p>
            Cleaning and formatting the data is a step necessary to produce accurate and meaningful visualizations. For
            this step, the timestamps were formatted to a readable data object. Some data was cleaned from the original
            Kaggle set, including 'publish_date' column, which has very little data overall, and any row where 'region'
            or 'language' are not defined.
            To enhance the readability of the charts, some changes were made: If the account had than 10,000 followers,
            they have been grouped into a language category "other". This enhances the readability of the chart.
            Likewise, if the account had less than 2000 followers, the region is grouped as "other". Once cleaned, the
            observations are reduced from nearly 400,000 rows to 112427 rows.
        </p>

        <h2>Highcharter Visualizations</h2>
        <figure class="project-img-small">
            <img src="images/highcharter-graph.png" alt="Daily follower counts based on language or region">
            <figcaption class="caption">Table 1: Highcharter Graph by J.D. Gi</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Table 1: This highcharter graph shows daily follower counts based on account language or region. Bots may
            avoid languages with limited readership to maximize impact and avoid bot detection. Western European
            languages dominate these results, aligning with the organization's goal of disrupting societies outside
            Russia and Asia.
        </p>

        <figure class="project-img-small">

            <figcaption class="caption">Table 2: Highcharter Graph by J.D. Gi</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Table 2: This highcharter table shows the languages of accounts with > 2000 followers. "Other" includes:
            Bengali, Bulgarian, Catalan, Czech, Estonian, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian,
            Japanese, Korean, Kurdish, Latvian, Macedonian, Malay, Pushto, Russian, Serbian, Simplified Chinese, Slovak,
            Slovenian, Somali, Swedish, Tagalog (Filipino), Thai, Traditional Chinese, Ukrainian. This also reflects
            that, despite being attributed to Russian bots, most account holders are in the United States.
        </p>

        <h2>Word Cloud & Hashtag Visualizations</h2>
        <figure class="project-img-small">
            <img src="images/word-cloud.png" alt="Word cloud of popular terms used by the bots">
            <figcaption class="caption">Table 3: Word Cloud by J.D. Gi</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Table 3: This wordcloud (limit 80 terms) displays most frequent strings, with stopwords set to English. Some
            single-character Cyrillic terms were unavoidable. These terms, recurring 100 times or more, emphasizes
            political jargon like trump, president, state, politics, and obama. Contrasting concepts (man/woman,
            life/killed, black/white, stop/go, never/now, weight/fitness), as well as direct commands (take, see, watch,
            think, vote, look, know) reveal the operation's objective: influencing readers through polarizing concepts
            and encouraging direct action.
        </p>

        <figure class="project-img-small">
            <img src="images/hashtag-mapping.png" alt="Hashtags used by the bots">
            <figcaption class="caption">Table 3: Hashtag Network by J.D. Gi</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Table 4: The hashtag network (limit 75 terms) reveals term frequency, with a min_freq set of 0.4 to exclude
            infrequently-used hashtags. Again, this highlights politically-polarizing terms, ie maga, trumptrain, blm,
            fergusonremembers. Bots integrate hashtags like soundcloud, hiphop, and meme trends to appear as genuine
            human users. They also employ 'rage bait' content on topics like the Second Amendment ('2a') and All Cops
            Are Bastards ('acab') to manipulate followers. Numerous hashtags with unclear significance, like 'arre --
            ara', 'alis -- lis', 'amelin -- ameliss', and 'ade -- aded', may result from lost context or gibberish
            generated by bots.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            The selection of this dataset was motivated by my recollection of the unfolding circumstances surrounding
            Russian bots on social media, a topic I avidly followed during that period. My curiosity was piqued by the
            prospect of delving into the data to discern the insights it might reveal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of particular note was the prevalence of missing elements within the dataset, prompting the exclusion of
            over
            200,000 rows due to the absence of language or region information. This raises questions, as it appears
            counterintuitive that accounts would lack such fundamental attributes. The exploration of these omissions
            warrants further inquiry to unveil the underlying reasons for this anomaly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of flexdashboard posed significant challenges, particularly surrounding the successful rendering of
            the
            file. I ran into the problem of graphs being compressed to a single row of pixels, or appearing as code
            instead
            of illustrative figures. Mitigating this issue necessitated extensive rearrangement and independent
            research.
            Ultimately, my decision was to compartmentalize sections into their own pages, a strategy that proved
            effective
            in resolving the rendering challenges. I look forward to delving deeper into flexdashboard in future
            projects.
        </p>
