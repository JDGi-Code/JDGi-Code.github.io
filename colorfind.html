        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Color blindness results from damage to or loss of retinal cones, which may be inherited or caused by injury.
            People who are color blind may struggle with making fashion choices that align with their personal
            preferences due to seeing colors differently than others. As a result, people with color blindness may
            frequently and unknowingly make fashion choices that are contrary to their personal preferences. Our
            research aims to better understand how to enhance accessibility of self-expression and autonomy for the
            color blind community through technology. Technology intended for individuals with visual impairment must
            comply with specific accessibility guidelines, such as high-contrast gray-scale, auditory prompts, and
            varying levels of conceptual explanations. ColorFind's user interface is designed with a monochromatic
            colorway and intuitive color theory fundamentals through the use of color wheels, ensuring maximum
            accessibility for users with different types of color blindness. Extensive user testing and competitor
            analysis have uncovered a promising market for accessible fashion, potentially improving the quality of life
            for individuals with visual impairments. Compelling user feedback indicates a demand for further
            development, including improved color theory label complexity and a database allowing users to save their
            closet contents, which could lead to greater user satisfaction.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Color blindness results from loss or damage to one or more of the cone types in the retina. This can be an
            inherited trait or may result from injury (Woods). There are five major types of color blindness, including:
            Protanopia (concerning red-hued colors such as red, orange, and yellow), Tritanopia (concerning blue-hued
            colors such as blue, purple, and red) and Deuteranopia (concerning green-hued colors, such as green, blue,
            and yellow), or a combination of any of these, as well as Achromatopsia (in which the individual sees in
            only gray hues). People who experience color blindness may struggle to make fashion choices due to seeing
            colors differently from the mainstream, and this may lead to frustration and embarrassment (Color Blind
            Awareness). Consumers seek to make sensible and trendy fashion choices without requiring third-party
            assistance; living independently is a fulfillment goal on multiple levels of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs,
            including physiological, esteem, and self-actualization (Mcleod). Current solutions for color blind
            individuals include durable equipment such as color-filtering glasses, gene therapy, and technical
            applications, however, these are are undermined by expense, inaccessibility, or being too niche to a
            specific color blindness to reach a wide consumer base. ColorFind is a solution that instantaneously answers
            questions related to a specific color, and is tailored to a wide range of vision types. The ColorFind mobile
            app is streamlined with minimal screens and few moving parts, which is ideal for users on a mission. Our
            system has been evaluated for optimization by a qualified industry expert, via the cognitive walk-through
            technique. Additionally, three test users evaluated our product using a think-aloud method, followed by
            post-hoc interviews. Their responses were studied using thematic analysis. What we discovered is that the
            simplified and streamlined design provides for wider accessibility and is appreciated by users.
            Additionally, a more expansive UI with enhanced color wheel labeling, as well as enhanced settings options,
            may improve the app to create the quintessential ColorFind experience.

        <h2>Related Work</h2>
        <p>
            Color blind people often struggle in their day-to-day life, with chores and responsibilities that involve
            differentiating colors of similar shades. Examples of this include, but are not limited to: Cooking,
            driving, entertainment-based activities, such as watching television and movies, or even enjoying the
            outdoors. Color blindness often restricts individuals from jobs that require identifying similar colors like
            engineering, military, and firefighting (Color Blind Guide). Currently, various technologies exist that are
            designed to support those who are color blind, ranging from tests, simulators, filters, games, and more
            physical objects like glasses and wearable technology (“Smartphone Based Image Color Correction for Color
            Blindness”). Despite their vast differences, many of these products tend to have similar pitfalls and user
            issues. As color blindness encompasses a broad spectrum of experiences, many tools and products are specific
            to one group of color blindness, which excludes entire subsets of the population. In order to combat this,
            some products and technologies attempt to apply one solution to the entire community. One option is gene
            therapy, which attempts to enhance the color vision of people through gene modification, but the technology
            is currently not considered safe enough as a mainstream treatment option. Another more common product is
            color blind glasses, a form of durable medical equipment (Salih). These glasses are made with specialized
            filters that allow the user to see more closely to how those with no color blindness see, but they are not
            universally effective. Similarly, contact lenses designed for color blind individuals follow similar
            pitfalls to the glasses. These physical devices need to be specialized, and are often expensive. Most
            recently, technological advances have emerged, that can be used as needed, without much investment, and
            which are intuitive to use. Examples of this include software-based products like color blind tests, which
            can help a user identify and track their color blindness, and color blind simulators which can help those
            without color blindness understand the lifestyle limitations for those with the condition.

        </figure>

        <p>In addition to these software products, others exist which to change color schemes on existing devices to
            make it easier for different people with color blindness to access common tools and applications (Vaibhav).
            A mobile application, "Color Blind Pal" (CBP) is available for iOS, Android, and Mac. This application
            attempts to provide complex names of colors captured through the device camera, which helps users identify
            colors. CBP also includes a function to shift color range to more extreme degrees. This color shift function
            makes colors that are within the user's identifiable spectrum more apparent and obvious. There are some
            elements of CBP that users report dissatisfaction with, as reported on the CBP user feedback page, such as a
            lack of a reversible camera function, an absence of text-to-speech functionality, and an "information
            overload" of complex color names (Fiorentini).

        <h2>Persona: Jozami</h2>
        <p>
            Jozami (they/them) has been red/monocrhomia color blind since birth and is frustrated by a tendency to buy mismatching clothes. 
            They want to diversify their wardrobe to be more stylish, while maintaining their high independence and avoiding asking for outside input. 
            When they enter a boutique and finds a shirt with tailoring and fabric that they like, Jozami begins to feel anxiety thinking about how they can't tell what color it is. 
            There are many shirts on the rack, but it is impossible for Jozami to tell if they are all the same, or different colors. 
            However, Jozami does not seek a third party's assistance in acquiring information.
            Will the shirt match other clothes that Jozami owns? If only there were a way to find out.
        </p>

        <h2>Persona: Terry</h2>
        <p>
            Terry enjoys clothes and has two closets and three dressers full of beautiful garments. 
            Terry, who experiences Tritanopia, only sees hues of pink and blue and struggles to feel confident in achieving his fashion goals. 
            He lives alone, and wants to make informed, independent choices while surprising his friends with his fashion acumen. 
            Terry selects a shirt and skirt, and although the fabrics feel nice together, he cannot be sure if they match. 
            Wouldn't it be nice to dress intentionally and with confidence?  
        </p>

        <h2>System Description</h2>
        <p>
            ColorFind provides features that makes a color-identifying mobile app more useful for color blind
            individuals. The system requirements include a smartphone or tablet with a camera, and an internet
            connection to download the application from the internet. The application will be available wherever
            applications are provided for such devices, including Google Play and the iPhone app library. This system
            was designed to optimize accessibility with a high-contrast gray-scale UI colorway, and minimal logo
            placement, to help users focus on the important features. The mobile application is streamlined with minimal
            screens and few moving parts, which is ideal for shoppers on a mission, with three main features: Shopping
            Companion, Color Capture, and Color Exploration.
        </p>
        <p>ColorFind's purpose is to help color blind people identify colors, to better facilitate making fashionable
            outfits. The ideal users, to whom this application is geared toward, are color blind individuals who wish to
            maintain their independence and expand their self-expression through fashion, in spite of the limitations of
            color blindness. Although all people can use the application, Color Find is not intentionally designed for
            color-seeing individuals who simply want to acquire color-matching hints provided by the application's
            features. Our intended userbase will benefit from ColorFind helping them identify colors of the clothing
            they select, and will help them avoid making fashion mistakes by introducing them to the fundamentals of
            color theory. Overall, our users will attain increased self-confidence in their appearance with the help of
            the application.
        </p>
        <p>As a Shopping Companion, ColorFind eliminates the need for a color blind person to ask for help from a third
            party, which provides autonomy-enhancing and personal empowerment benefits. First, the application's color
            scheme is in a monochromatic gray scale. Given the variations in color blindness types, a gray scale allows
            for the highest level of accessibility for the largest number of users. A front-facing camera option, or
            camera direction reversal, helps users with selfie-oriented tasks such as makeup application and evaluating
            the outfit they are currently wearing. The text-to-speech feature offers improved information access by
            providing audible information via the device's audio function. This is another feature that is not available
            with CBP, but which ColorFind considers standard. For many people with vision problems, it can be difficult
            to try to read the name of a color on their phone screen, and the audio function helps them while they are
            creating an outfit. The text size slider further improves accessibility for users with low vision. Light and
            dark modes better accommodate users with special vision disorders, such as cataracts and myopia (Budiu). In
            general, ColorFind is an application that strives to enhance personal autonomy, to give the user power to
            identify and successfully create matching combinations.
        </p>
        <p>Color blind people experience difficulty identifying colors. This difficulty may be in seeing entire portions
            of the color spectrum, or in difficulty determining the difference between colors (Turbert). The Color
            Capture feature helps users identify colors, by name, that they ordinarily would be unable to recognize, due
            to color blindness. When the user takes a picture of a piece of clothing using their camera device function,
            the system will return the name of the color that it sees. The user begins in 'simple' mode by default,
            however they may select 'complex' mode via the Settings menu.
        </p>
        <p>The modal distinction for user levels is significant. Through studying the user feedback statements of the
            competitor model "Color Blind Pal", as well as through our target user interview responses, we have
            identified that some users become overwhelmed with a flood of individualized, nuanced names for colors they
            cannot see (Fiorentini). This app will be improved and enhanced compared to the competitor CBP, as the user
            feedback indicates the nuance of full spectrum color names is "information overload."
        </p>

        <figure class="project-img-large">
            <img src="images/colorfind-lightmode-flow.png" alt="Application flow in light mode">
        </figure>

        <figure class="project-img-large">
            <img src="images/colorfind-darkmode-flow.png" alt="Application flow in light mode">

        </figure>

        <p>
            Users may not wish to know the names for every shade of pink in the present moment, by their individualized
            names. Given the inability of color blind individuals to see the hues translates to an inability to
            appreciate the distinction between hues, and when faced with many complicated and individualized color names
            leads to frustration for some.
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, ColorFind will provide a setting to shift between 'simple' and 'complex' color names. Under the
            'simple' setting, the system will return standard ROYGBIV color names (i.e. 'pink', 'green'). If the user is
            curious they may go deeper, change the setting to 'complex', and view the full spectrum names (i.e. 'peach',
            'aquamarine').
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, complex mode will return the hex code for the color, which is a color-identifying method used
            and recognized by many industries and areas of the economy (Pluralsight). The hex code provides the color
            saturation, in numeric format, for the red, blue, and green content of a color, and can be helpful for
            certain users trying to better understand color shades. Overall, the Color Capture feature helps users
            maintain more control over their fashion choices.
        </p>
        <p>The Color Exploration feature helps users create matching outfits using color theory fundamentals. Color
            theory is the art and science of using color, and includes color relationship and color associations. Color
            theory fundamentals help users understand the relationships between colors, which is especially important
            for color blind individuals. Color theory is most clearly communicated through color wheels, arranged in a
            circular spectrum that displays all the ROYGBIV colors at once in a compact way (Iconic Creative Blog).
        </p>
        <p>After using the Color Capture, users may access Color Exploration through selecting the 'more information'
            button. This is signified by the universal icon for information (a lower-case letter 'i' enclosed in a
            circle). Selecting this button opens the Color Exploration feature, which shows color wheels, which help
            users better visualize the concept of "matching colors" on the color spectrum, as well as how colors
            associate and relate with each other. ColorFind offers multiple dimensions of color theory fundamentals,
            including complimentary, analogous, triadic, and tetradic color combinations. Complimentary colors are
            directly opposite each other on the color wheel, while analogous are adjacent. Triadic colors are
            three-color combinations, and tetradic colors are four-color combinations. A color blind user will, in
            general, be able to see at least a portion of the color wheel, and use them to create a visually-appealing
            and intentional outfit. When users gain skills to create more expressive choices, they will feel more
            empowered to make confident decisions.
        </p>
        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>To evaluate the product's performance, we measured the user's ability to intuitively navigate the system
            without any instruction, as well as the effectiveness of the monochromatic color scheme. To test these
            metrics, we have used multiple methods, including a cognitive walk-through with an industry expert, and
            usability testing with three test users, using a think-aloud with post-hoc interview.
        </p>
        <p>First, we conducted a cognitive walk-through evaluation with professional application developer C. Furman of
            Klayvio, Inc. Furman, a qualified expert with 15 years of professional training, performed the cognitive
            walk-through and provided guidance on the usability of features. While no functional difficulties were
            identified, guidance was provided as to prototyping. Furman indicated that in the demonstration of final
            prototypes, it is customary for a text size feature to be indicated, but but not demonstrated through
            functionality. Otherwise, said Furman, "designers would be forced to create 10 or more different models,
            each with a different text size, creating redundant work with little benefit." Taking this expert's advice,
            we did not dynamically implement this function on the prototype. Additionally, Furman advised for minimal
            "logo stamping" on the application screens, stating "The customer just wants to use your application.
            They've already opened the app on their phone; they know what app they're using and don't need to be
            confronted with the app logo on the camera screen." Therefore, we have opted to maximize the screen real
            estate by including our app logo in two places only: On the Settings screen, as this will confirm for the
            user that they are changing settings for this app only, and on the Color Exploration page, as this will
            encourage brand association with the unique feature.
        </p>
        <p>Recruitment of our test users was conducted via peer survey to identify color blind individuals who are
            interested in improving their fashion choices through better understanding color relationships. For our
            three test users, we employed a think-aloud observation, combined with post-hoc interviews confined to less
            than ten questions each. The questionnaire was a combination of closed- and open-ended questions, to gain
            targeted responses where needed as well as to give users flexibility to talk about their feelings about the
            application.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <i>How did you feel using the application?</i> The purpose of this question is to gauge user mood (for
                example, excitement or frustration) after using the application.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Do you feel you require a user tutorial to understand the system? Yes or No.</i> This closed-ended
                question is asked to gauge whether users felt the application was simple enough to figure out on their
                own, without instructions from a tutorial, or if a tutorial should be evaluated as a option that would
                enhance the application.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Do you understand what all the buttons do? Yes or No.</i> This closed-ended question is asked to
                determine if the signifiers on the buttons were designed in an intuitive way for the user.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>If not, which buttons were confusing to use?</i> This follow-up to question 3 aims to identify which,
                if any, buttons were unclear insofar as purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Is there any part of the UI that is difficult to see due to your own vision impairment?</i> The
                purpose of this question is to identify areas of the application that are lacking in accessibility.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Do the color wheels help you understand color relationships? Yes or No.</i> This question aims to
                gauge the effectiveness of the Color Exploration feature.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Do you think you would use ColorFind to help you make outfits?</i> This is similar to question 5,
                however asked in a different way. First, in question 5, we are asking if the user understands the color
                wheels, whereas this question is asking if the user believes the application as a whole could be useful
                for outfit creation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>What are the parts that you like the most about the system?</i> Similar to question 1, here we are
                asking an open-ended question to understand more about what parts the users like the most, with the goal
                of responses providing insight into areas that could be developed further.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Can you think of any way this application could be improved for ease of use?</i> Here we are asking
                if any part of the application is difficult to use, using unbiased language. Rather than asking "What
                parts do you dislike the most," which would be the opposite of question 7, we are asking a more focused
                question that could give us insight into where the application is not meeting user needs.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            In our analysis, we discovered our test users had similar, as well as unique, responses. Our users gained
            the impression that ColorFind has streamlined functionality, and is 'easy' and 'simple to use'; as well as
            being helpful for making outfits.
            Universally, our test users enjoyed the Color Exploration feature the most, in that it provided insight into
            how colors interact to form relationships and associations. Although we obtained the desired impression from
            all our test users, however, we also gained valuable insights and unique perspectives that were valuable as
            well. For instance, user Susu suggested that instead of a colors given hex code, RBG values should be
            offered. A hex code is a version of RBG saturation values, however a change to the UI would be required to
            accommodate Susu's particular user preference. Further usability testing would be required to determine if
            this would benefit more users. User Shishir suggested more attractive fonts. The subjective impression of
            the app's appearance may be improved with a marketing study involving a survey on a larger user base, with
            multiple visual UI options. User Stanley suggested the color wheels could be labeled. This insightful
            suggestion could be a very useful for future iterations of ColorFind. If users cannot see areas of the color
            wheel, then they would benefit from the labels, however the UI would need to change to allow for this
            labeling. A further suggestion given by user Stanley was to implement a setting to toggle visibility of the
            hex code. As this user suggested, "hex codes do not mean anything to me, so it would be nice to turn that
            off if I wanted to." This is a suggestion that would likely benefit a wide user base, and we would be
            interested in implementing in future iterations of our application.
        </p>


        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The process of creating the ColorFind app has been richly rewarding for us as developers and designers. We
            have learned a great deal about accessibility, and appreciation of differing user needs, as well as the
            benefits of confining our design scope to the primary user requirements. To reach the widest user base, and
            thereby improve quality of life for the color blind community, listening to user needs is essential. Future
            iterations of the application may include some or all of the suggestions provided by our User Evaluation, as
            resources permit. Additionally, we consider a function to save and remember settings to be essential to some
            users going forward. A database capability to allow users to save their closet contents could drastically
            expand the market interest for our application. In addition to this, an OS browser extension that could
            accompany the user in their internet browsing and help them navigate news articles, social media, email
            attachments, and more, could potentially seamlessly integrate color identification into the daily lives of
            color blind individuals. These findings imply a promising market opportunity to enhance the quality of life
            for the color blind community.
